# Running Unit Tests

To run the tests,

## 1. Build the main project

The main project should be built first. If the main project is not built then run the command:

```console
pnpm build
```

## 2. Go to test directory

```console
cd tests/unit
```

## 3. Install test dependencies

```console
pnpm install
```

## 4. Run test

```console
pnpm test:unit
```
