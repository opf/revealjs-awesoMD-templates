# Adding a new presentation

To create a presentation, 

1. create a folder in the `markdown` folder of this repository. e.g. `markdown/new-presentation` 
2. create a markdown file in the created folder. e.g. `markdown/new-presentation/new-presentation.md`
3. if you have images in the presentation, add them to the `markdown/new-presentation` folder.

```

└── markdown
    ├── new-presentation
    │   ├── new-presentation.md
    │   ├── new-presentation-image-01.png
    │   └ ...      
    ├── demo
    │   ├── demo.md
    │   ├── demo-image-01.png
    │   └ ...      
    └ ...
```

For how slides are structured in the markdown file, see [Presentation Markdown Structure](./presentation-structure.md).
